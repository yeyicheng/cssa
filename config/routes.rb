	# Sample of regular route:
	#   match 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'
	# Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action
	
	# Sample of named route:
	#   match 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', :as => :purchase
	# This route can be invoked with purchase_url(:id => product.id)
	
	# Sample resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
	#   resources :products
	
	# Sample resource route with options:
	#   resources :products do
	#     member do
	#       get 'short'
	#       post 'toggle'
	#     end

	#   resources :products do
	#     resources :comments, :sales
	#     resource :seller
	#   end
	
	# Sample resource route with more complex sub-resources

	#     resources :sales do
	#       get 'recent', :on => :collection

	# Sample resource route within a namespace:
	#   namespace :admin do
	#     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
	#     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
	#     resources :products

	# This is a legacy wild controller route that's not recommended for RESTful applications.
	# Note: This route will make all actions in every controller accessible via GET requests.
	# match ':controller(/:action(/:id))(.:format)'
